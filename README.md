An actually simple and gas-efficient Uniswap router with [`zAMM`](https://zamm.finance/).

Each version has dedicated entrypoint function with similar args:

- `swapV2()`
- `swapV3()`
- `swapV4()`
- `swapVZ()`

Features:

- cheapest singlehop for every single version of uniswap
- multihop through a simple call chain via `multicall()`
- slippage protection on each hop inside multihop chains
- bridges all liquid ERC20s with ERC6909 finance on zAMM
- includes WETH abstraction for all ETH input and output

Deployed to [0x0000000000404FECAf36E6184245475eE1254835](https://contractscan.xyz/contract/0x0000000000404FECAf36E6184245475eE1254835) on Ethereum and Base.

Router helper (`zQuoter`) deployed to [0x658bF1A6608210FDE7310760f391AD4eC8006A5F](https://etherscan.io/address/0x658bf1a6608210fde7310760f391ad4ec8006a5f#code).

Great for bots, on-the-fly strategies, and aggregation.

Bonus: Includes V2-style SushiSwap pools in `swapV2()`.

## Base deployment

Supports Aerodrome methods, `swapAero()`, `swapAeroCL()`. No SushiSwap. Otherwise ABI and Uniswap methods remain the same.

## Security note

Ensure atomic token allowances for best security. Previous versions may not have allowance guard.

## Dev tips

- If using hookless zamm (0x00...888), set `deadline` to `type(uint256).max` to trigger in `swapVZ()`
- If using SushiSwap (classic), set `deadline` to `type(uint256).max` to trigger in `swapV2()`

Both case default deadline to `(now) + 30 minutes`, which is a reasonable staleness guard.

## zRouter vs Uniswap – Gas Benchmarks

**Summary:** zRouter is most gas-efficient for routes between AMMs and single-hop swaps. zRouter consistently outgasses Uniswap routers for common paths — clean sweeps on V2 (single/multi), and on V3 and V4 singles, and sizable savings vs Universal Router on cross‑AMM routes (2/2 wins). Multihop V3/V4 paths are the next optimization target, and where gas loses out for sake of simplicity and multi-AMM handling.
